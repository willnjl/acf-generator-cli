# ACF Field Generator CLI

## Overview

The ACF Field Generator CLI is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to expedite the process of generating PHP boilerplate code for Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) from a JSON representation. This tool aims to reduce the time and effort spent on the repetitive task of translating ACF field configurations into PHP code.

## Features

- **JSON to PHP Conversion:** Converts ACF field configurations stored in JSON format into corresponding PHP boilerplate code.
  
- **Customizable Output:** Allows users to specify output preferences, such as the file name, directory, and other relevant options.

- **Time Savings:** Automates the generation of PHP boilerplate code, saving developers significant time and effort.

### Options

- `--input`: Path to the input JSON file containing ACF field configurations.
  
- `--output`: Path to the output PHP file where the generated code will be saved.

- (Optional) Additional options to customize the output.
